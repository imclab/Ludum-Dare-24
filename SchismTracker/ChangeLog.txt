	actually apply sharp/flat switch setting at startup
	[b875281eedec]

	* configure.ac:
	New clang won't build clean with ludicrous - apparently -Wcast-align
	semantics changed. Obviously the "correct" answer is to fix the
	code, but that's somewhat more involved than I'd like to get into at
	the moment.

	* Makefile.am, fmt/mid.c, include/fmt-types.h:
	.mid loader! Still needs lots of work, but it kind of functions.

	* AUTHORS, COPYING.frag-opt, Makefile.am, include/frag-opt.h, schism
	/frag-opt.c, schism/main.c:
	replace frag-opt with plain gnu getopt Sorry, Midianian, but for
	some reason it wasn't actually parsing any options anymore, and
	getopt is standard (well, mostly) and really not much different
	anyway. Plus, I'd like the --help output to fit cleanly on one
	screen, which it totally wasn't.

	The only clear drawback to this change is plus-negation doesn't work
	anymore (+p, +f), so I had to invent some other way to handle those.
	I wonder how many people actually used these options, though. (In
	fact, I wonder how many people make regular use of the command line
	options *at all*...)

	[Apologies for anyone who's not on a system where getopt_long
	exists. I'll sort out an autoconf macro to replace it eventually.]

	* fmt/it.c, include/midi.h, schism/audio_loadsave.c,
	schism/page_midi.c:
	Make MIDI config embed flag a song property rather than a global
	one; set it only if special bit 4 is set This is not quite
	completely accurate behavior yet -- noticeably, MIDI config
	shouldn't be reset when loading a file that doesn't have it
	embedded. The flag, though, IS entirely a song property -- when
	loading a .s3m for example, the embed switch is turned off.
	[5cd383aea5b9]

	special bits 1 and 2 are set iff history data is present (thx Saga)
