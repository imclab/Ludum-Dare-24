PINBOLOGY
=========

> It is ancient Earth, and in a pond filled with primordial ooze things have just come to life...

PINBOLOGY attempts to faithfully mimic the components, mechanics, and physics of old electro-mechanical pinball machines while incorporating zones, combos, and special actions themed around evolution. 

This game was made entirely before a livestream audience of 200-500 people. While I created all the art and program code myself, they provided invaluable moral support and inspiration, and I want to thank everyone who watched. I can't wait for LD #25!!!
